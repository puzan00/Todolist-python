# Todolist-python.
I have created todolist app with django that includes user authentication.
This means that users will need to create an account and log in to access the app's features, such as creating ,editing etc . 
I have focused on backend part rather than frontend.
Additionally, the user authentication system will ensure that each user's data is securely stored and only accessible to them.
